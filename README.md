# 📊 Actuarial Claims Frequency Analysis — Auto Portfolio

This project presents an actuarial analysis of claim frequency in an automobile insurance portfolio based on the **French Motor Claims Dataset (freMTPL2freq)**.

The original dataset is large and computationally demanding. To ensure efficient handling and visualization in Excel, a **representative subset of the data** was used while preserving the statistical structure of the portfolio. This allows practical actuarial exploration without compromising analytical validity.

The objective of the project is to analyze how key risk factors affect claim frequency and to support **data-driven decisions in pricing, underwriting, and portfolio risk management**.
